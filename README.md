# Risiko
A python module that outputs probabilities to lose troops in the game risk (german:'Risiko').

-Use expected_lose(dots, dices_attack, dices_defend) to calculate the expected value of troops to lose in an attack with 'dices_attack' dices vs 'dices_defend' dices with 'dots' dots.


-Use expected_win(dots, dices_attack, dices_defend) to calculate the expected value of troops to lose in defense with 'dices_defend' vs 'dices_attack' with 'dots' dots.
